# Usage

First thing to do to use this script, is making it executable with the following command:

`chmod +x backup.sh`

Once you're sure it's executable, simply type

`sh backup.sh`

or

`./backup.sh`

to run the script and perform a backup of your hosting.

Don't forget to add this script in every user's cronjob you want to backup.
