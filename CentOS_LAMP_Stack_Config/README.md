# Usage

First thing to do to use this script, is making it executable with the following command:

`chmod +x CentOS_LAMP_Stack_Config.sh`

Once you're sure it's executable, simply type

`sh CentOS_LAMP_Stack_Config.sh`

or

`./CentOS_LAMP_Stack_Config.sh`

to run the script and configure a CentOS-based LAMP Stack server.
