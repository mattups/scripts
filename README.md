# Scripts
Just a collection of various shell scripts i write to simplify my work.

# Why?

You know, sometimes you could find it hard to achieve a task, or simply you got bored of doing the same thing over and over.
That's why i'm going to upload them here, maybe someone could find them helpful.

# Platforms

Currently most of my work is Linux-based, but i will upload scripts for Windows, too.

# Usage

* CentOS_LAMP_Stack_Config.sh

First thing to do to use this script, is making it executable with the following command:

`chmod +x CentOS_LAMP_Stack_Config.sh`

Once you're sure it's executable, simply type

`sh CentOS_LAMP_Stack_Config.sh`

or

`./CentOS_LAMP_Stack_Config.sh`

to run the script and configure a CentOS-based LAMP Stack server.
