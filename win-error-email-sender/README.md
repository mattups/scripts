# Windows error email sender

This is a simple script to send an email with some useful data:
- Hostname
- Last boot time
- Last shutdown event (you can check the EventIDs in the script)

All you need to do is configure the needed parameters in the script and you're ready.

Once you've tested it, you can put it in your machine's scheduled tasks on startup to get an email if it boots up.

Tested on Windows 10, Windows Server 2016.
